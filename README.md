## What is the OnTime API?

The [OnTime API](https://www.ontime360.com/overviewapi.aspx) makes it possible to develop applications that interface with the data contained in an OnTime account over the internet. The OnTime API allows numerous ways to access and manipulate the data associated with an OnTime account. There are two versions of the OnTime API: a SOAP implementation and a REST implementation. Both of these implementations provide identical functionality, which allows developers to choose whichever implementation best suits their development needs.

OnTime provides an unparalleled developer experience for those using commercial [courier software](https://www.ontime360.com). You'll find extensive development tools for both web-based and desktop projects.
